GUI
===

Mr. Youngblood at the University of Incarnate Word demonstrated how to create Windows using C++ on the windows Operating system, but apple computers could not follow along.
Apple users were having a problem making windows in C++ without the Windows API provided by Microsoft Windows.
There is a simple way of making windows and views on an Apple computer using Objective-C and Apples API's, however this project is in C++ so we can't use the Apple API's.

OpenGL, OpenAL, and GLUT were used to solve this problem. The included x-code project and main.cpp file will build a GUI that has a very colorful triangle.
